# Javascript Data Structures
I just wanted to practice data structures

# Why this repo?
Because I'm trying to [Learn in Public](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579).

# I want to contribute/fix an issue/add a new data structure
By all means, go ahead! The whole point of this repository is learning, so I'm
open to any improvement or feedback you'd like to provide :)
