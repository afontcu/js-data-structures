# Javascript Data Structures
I just wanted to practice data structures. This repository contains (or will contain)
several documents, code snippets and examples.

# Why this repo?
Because I'm trying to [Learn in Public](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579).

# Resources
Following is a list of resources I used to increase my understanding of data
structures:

* [Introduction to Data Structures for Interviews. Bianca Gandolfo, Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/data-structures-interviews)
* [Big-O Algorithm Complexity Cheatsheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
* [A beginner's guide to Big O notation. Rob Bell](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)

_(it'll keep growing)_

# I want to contribute/fix an issue/add a new data structure
By all means, go ahead! The whole point of this repository is learning, so I'm
open to any improvement or feedback you'd like to provide :)
